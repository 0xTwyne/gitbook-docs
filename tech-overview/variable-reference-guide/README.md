# Variable Reference Guide

Understanding Twyne’s mechanics requires navigating between mathematical theory and practical implementation. This reference guide serves as your “Rosetta Stone” for translating between the whitepaper’s elegant mathematical notation, the litepaper’s simplified expressions, and the Solidity code’s implementation details.

### Why This Guide Exists <a href="#why-this-guide-exists" id="why-this-guide-exists"></a>

When building DeFi protocols, we often face a fundamental tension between mathematical clarity and implementation practicality. The whitepaper uses notation like `C`, `B`, and `C_LP` because these symbols create clean, readable equations. However, Solidity code must handle precision issues, gas optimization, and naming conventions that make sense to developers. This guide bridges that gap, helping you understand how theoretical concepts map to actual code.
